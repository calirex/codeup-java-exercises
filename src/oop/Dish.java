//    /        -- OOP SHORT ASSIGNMENT #1 --
//        Create a class called Dish. This class will represent various restaurant dishes.
//        Include an integer property called “costInCents”
//        Include a string property called “nameOfDish”
//        Include a boolean property called “wouldRecommend”
//        Include a method called “printSummary” with a void return type
//        this method will use a single printf method to print out the values of each of the instance properties in the following format:
//        Cost: COST_IN_CENTS_HERE
//        Name: NAME_OF_DISH_HERE
//        Recommended: BOOLEAN_VALUE_OF_WOULD_RECOMMEND_HERE
//        Create another class called DishTest
//                Add a main method and inside the method...
//        1) instantiate a Dish object and assign to a variable called dish1
//        2) assign creative values for each of the properties
//        3) test the printSummary() method by invoking it and checking if all instance values are correctly printed
